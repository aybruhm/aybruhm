  <samp>I am <b>Abram</b>, a passionate self-taught python developer and software engineer. I have over 4 years of personal and professional experience developing and designing software for the web, from simple landing pages, custom web and restful applications to building full fledged end-user systems. I have a knack for not panicking in the face of complexity. I break things down into manageable chunks, and tackle them with the tools at my disposal.</samp>

<p align="center"><samp>Logic. Patience. Communication, and Attention to detail are my underlying strengths. </samp></p>

<h2 align="center"><samp>More about me!</samp></h2>

<div align="center">
<samp>I am a huge fan of Open Source! I have contributed to a few (<b>AutSPACEs</b>, and <b>PyJWT</b>) and have created some. Here are a few things you can learn from an Open Source community:</samp>
</div>

<br />

<div align="center">
<samp>- Working on an open source project with a group of people you’ve never met teaches you a lot about how to interact with people. You quickly discover that everyone has their own pressures, their own commitments, and differing timescales. Learning how to work collaboratively with a group of strangers is a great life skill.</samp> <br />
<samp>- Possibly the most powerful concept behind open source is that it allows you to harness a global network of creative, intelligent, and knowledgeable individuals. I know I have my limits, and I don’t know everything, but engaging with the open source community helps me improve my creations.</samp> <br />
<samp>- If the documentation for a project is unclear or incomplete, I don’t hesitate to make it better. One small update or fix might save a developer only a <samp>few minutes, but multiplied across all the users, your one small change can have a significant impact.</samp>
