## Nē, utsukushī ningen! 👋

<br>

My names are Abraham Israel. I go by the unique code name Abram 🍀🐼, I am a passionate self-taught python developer and software engineer from Africa/Nigeria. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true by translating them into elegant interfaces. I have over 4 years of experience developing and designing software for the web, from simple landing pages, custom web applications to building enhanced end-user functionality.

<br>

I am a huge fan of Open Source! I have contributed to **[AutSPACEs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/)**, and **[PyJWT](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/)**. Here are a few things you can learn from an Open Source community;

- Working on an open source project with a group of people you’ve never met teaches you a lot about how to interact with people. You quickly discover that everyone has their own pressures, their own commitments, and differing timescales. Learning how to work collaboratively with a group of strangers is a great life skill.
- Possibly the most powerful concept behind open source is that it allows you to harness a global network of creative, intelligent, and knowledgeable individuals. I know I have my limits, and I don’t know everything, but engaging with the open source community helps me improve my creations.
- If the documentation for a project is unclear or incomplete, I don’t hesitate to make it better. One small update or fix might save a developer only a few minutes, but multiplied across all the users, your one small change can have a significant impact.

<br>

With that said, 


- 👨🏽‍🌱 I’m currently Exploring ReactJS, Docker and DevOps!
- 💼 If you are looking for a talented Backend (Python) software engineer that speaks in RESTful APIs, and has the ability to translate UI design(s) to elegant Frontend code to work on a project, or on a contract role. Feel free to reach out to me via this [email](mailto:israelvictory87@gmail.com) :)
- 💬 Oh, finally. I run a [blog](https://digitalstade.com/) where I talk about tech from time to time. You can also ask me about anything on Python, Backend Development, System Design, Automation, APIs, & Django; I will be happy to help!
