<h2>More about me!</h2>

<div>
    <samp>I am a huge fan of Open Source! I have contributed to a few (<b>AutSPACEs</b>, and <b>PyJWT</b>) and have created some. Here are a few things you can learn from an Open Source community:</samp>
</div>

<br />

<div>
    <samp>- Working on an open source project with a group of people you’ve never met teaches you a lot about how to interact with people. You quickly discover that everyone has their own pressures, their own commitments, and differing timescales. Learning how to work collaboratively with a group of strangers is a great life skill.</samp> <br />
    <samp>- Possibly the most powerful concept behind open source is that it allows you to harness a global network of creative, intelligent, and knowledgeable individuals. I know I have my limits, and I don’t know everything, but engaging with the open source community helps me improve my creations.</samp> <br />
    <samp>- If the documentation for a project is unclear or incomplete, I don’t hesitate to make it better. One small update or fix might save a developer only a <samp>few minutes, but multiplied across all the users, your one small change can have a significant impact.</samp>
