Hi, I'm Abram.

Here are some of the stacks I've worked with since 2019:

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| **Languages** | Python, JavaScript, TypeScript |
| **Frameworks & Runtimes** | FastAPI, Django (REST Framework, Ninja), React, Svelte, Node.js/Nest.js |
| **CI/CD Pipelines** | Jenkins, Github Actions |
| **Cloud Platforms** | AWS (EC2, S3, ECR, Lambda, SQS, DocuementDB, RDS, Bedrock, CloudFront, Secrets Manager, ElastiCache, CloudWatch, VPC, IAM), Google Cloud (Compute Engine, Cloud Storage) |
| **Databases** | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Pinecone, Qdrant, ChromaDB |
| **Testing** | pytest (unit, integration, functional, characterization), pytest-asyncio, unittest.mock, playwright |
| **Agentic AI & Orchestration** | Multi-agent systems (OpenAI Agents SDK, PydanticAI, LangGraph), LLM observability, tool calling, RAG pipelines (pgvector, etc) |
| **Messaging & Event-Driven** | Celery, AWS SQS, RabbitMQ, Kafka (event sourcing, streaming), Redis Pub/Sub |

I'm currently building a multi-agent AI system that acts as my personal financial advisor and accountant.

Outside of engineering, I consume stories and study financial markets.
