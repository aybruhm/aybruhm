Hi, I'm Abram.

Here are some of the stacks I've worked with since 2021:

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frameworks & Runtimes**: FastAPI, Django (REST Framework, Ninja), React, Svelte, Node.js/Nest.js
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Jenkins, Github Actions
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (EC2, S3, ECR, Lambda, SQS, Bedrock), Google Cloud (Compute Engine, Cloud Storage)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Pinecone, Qdrant, ChromaDB
- **Agentic AI & Orchestration**: Multi-agent systems (OpenAI Agents SDK, PydanticAI, LangGraph), LLM observability, tool calling, RAG pipelines (pgvector, etc)
- **Messaging & Event-Driven**: Celery, AWS SQS, RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Pub/Sub

I'm currently building a multi-agent AI system that acts as my personal financial advisor and accountant.

Outside of engineering, I consume stories (manga, dystopian cinema, anime) and study financial markets.
